                            <p>A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, 
                                that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. 
                                By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data</p>
