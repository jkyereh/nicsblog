                                    The beauty of Shopify is, you can still make some money even if you don’t have any products to sell.
                                    This is so because Shopify also has a drop-shipping feature you can take advantage of and make money.
                                    With drop-shipping, you sell goods to customers directly to customers from suppliers or manufacturers.

                            a chance at whatever they’re applying for. This could fetch you some real cash as people are already 
                            paying to use software to write their resumes.

                                     Better still you can dedicate one room in your house to this effect, 
                                     furnishing it and make it look standard for a paying guest to enjoy their stay in.

                                <p>Blogging has been around for a while now, so people are already aware of this. 
                                    Vlogging on the hand is quite new, but its all in the same line. 
                                    Blogging deals with getting articles online about something or someone, 
                                    usually a niche you can write so well about, like entertainment, fashion, tech,
                                     etc. Vlogging is also about making videos on subject matters just like the 
                                     above listed. You could just film your travels or even your daily live. 
                                     To make money from this, you would need to pull in some huge traffic to whatever 
                                     platform you are using so you could advertise to people coming on that site 
                                     and earn commissions from these adverts. Usually, most people use YouTube as it 
                                     is easier to monetize your content there.
                                </p>

                                <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
                                <p>Creative minds can benefit a lot from this business. 
                                    Once you can put someone’s creative idea or imagination into an artistic piece,
                                     you’re sure to make some real cash here. It could be flyers, banners, posters,
                                     etc, or logos. Just be able to design something catchy and earn on that.
