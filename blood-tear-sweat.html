                        <p>  A friend once said "if you are cutting a tree with an axe between your bare hands, you will always end 
                            up having blisters before you finish the job"...</p>
                        <p>Years ago when I was 14, I wanted to become a soldier, a basketball professional player and a professional wrestler, 
                            all at the same time. Unfortunately, my parents opposed to all these ideas, claiming that "you are not gonna do useless things!". 
                            However, most parents, if not all, want a bright future for their kids. "Well, but you do not give me any idea", 
                            I said internally. Upset, I decided to rebel against them. I dropped out from high school for 2 years, 
                            lying to my parents that I subscribed for evening class sessions. Not limited to that, I decided to find few jobs so as to 
                            make money..</p>

                       <p>
                                I liked spending time at the gym during that period, because it helped me dream and feel strong. But it was a short dream, 
                                reality bounced back and my parents discovered that I dropped out for 2 years.
                                I was always waiting for a solution to appear by magic, neither giving any orientation to my life nor even thinking about the future.
                                The day I came back from my random occupation, my father organized a family meeting. He barely looked at me, ashamed, and asked 
                                "what do you want to do with your life?"and I said "I don't Know". Then, my mother cried
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                               <p>  I never saw my mother crying for me before. It was as if I received a severe electroshock... 
                                   it was horribly painful. I could not even cry when I realized what I had done . Since then, 
                                   I decided to do all I can to never make her cry again, but smile forever and paying for all the bad things 
                                   that I have done. Of course, it was a challenge to find my way... but this time I was determine to succeed. 
                                </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Afterwards, I engaged in a deep introspection to define what I liked; and I found out that I liked making 
                            new friends, making people smile and solving their problems by giving them advice. I finally had a passion!
                            To further understand what career I really wanted to follow, I returned to school and successfully completed high school education, 
                            but I never gave up on my favorite sports.</p>

                        <h1>Resume Writer</h1>
                        <p>If you’re good at writing and profiling people, 
                            you could write resumes and CVs for potential employees or students to land them 
                            a chance at whatever they’re applying for. This could fetch you some real cash as people are already 
                            paying to use software to write their resumes.

                                <p> However, during the application period for undergraduate programs, I had a sever injury: 
                                    complete rupture of thigh-knee tendon. I had a surgery. The recovery was really painful, 
                                    but the pain was a mixture of physical and mental stresses. Still on my hospital bed, 
                                    I received a news that my application for the faculty of Political Science and Public Administration 
                                    failed... I was even more depressed; my only chance to succeed vanished... I did not want to live 
                                    anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>After a week of reflection, I understood that I have only two choice in this life: succeeding or die trying. 
                                    I swore to myself that I will never ever let my passion fade away, no matter what happens. 
                                    From that day, my life changed! I decided to take every challenge, big or small; nourishing my heart with passion
                                     and determination... I made pain and hard times my friends forever.

                                <p>  After my rehabilitation, I decided to resume my physical activities  earlier, 
                                    against the recommendation of my orthopedist. Luckily, after 3 months I totally recovered 
                                    and was able to make 13 seconds in a 100m run. I was back to my feet.

                                    <p>  I applied for a British university campus abroad, I had to study English, as I was not really
                                         proficient enough. I put my hands together and worked hard, and I finally got admitted at 
                                         Lancaster University Ghana campus (LUG) under the faculty of Politics and International Relations.

                                            As my English was not perfect, I was always the object of mockery in class and I had problems communicating academically and professionally..., but I never gave up.
                                          
                                            Through my relentless passion and determination, I witnessed the unfolding achievements:
                                          
                                           - I was elected  Secretary General of the LUG Politics and Debate Society only a month after my arrival in first year.
                                          
                                           - I participated in 2 simulations of United Nations conference as delegate then official.

                                <p> - I set up with a team the LUG French Club and became its vice-president. 

                                        - I made hundreds of local and foreign friends that I love and respect a lot.
                                       
                                        - Finally, I recently got accepted for a summer internship program at the Diaspora African Forum,
                                         an African Union endorsed diplomatic mission.
