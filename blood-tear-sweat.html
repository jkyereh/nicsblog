                        <p>  A friend once said "if you are cutting a tree with an axe between your bare hands, you will always end 
                            up having blisters before you finish the job"...</p>
                        <p>Years ago when I was 14, I wanted to become a soldier, a basketball professional player and a professional wrestler, 
                            all at the same time. Unfortunately, my parents opposed to all these ideas, claiming that "you are not gonna do useless things!". 
                            However, most parents, if not all, want a bright future for their kids. "Well, but you do not give me any idea", 
                            I said internally. Upset, I decided to rebel against them. I dropped out from high school for 2 years, 
                            lying to my parents that I subscribed for evening class sessions. Not limited to that, I decided to find few jobs so as to 
                            make money..</p>

                       <p>
                                I liked spending time at the gym during that period, because it helped me dream and feel strong. But it was a short dream, 
                                reality bounced back and my parents discovered that I dropped out for 2 years.
                                I was always waiting for a solution to appear by magic, neither giving any orientation to my life nor even thinking about the future.
                                The day I came back from my random occupation, my father organized a family meeting. He barely looked at me, ashamed, and asked 
                                "what do you want to do with your life?"and I said "I don't Know". Then, my mother cried
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                               <p>  I never saw my mother crying for me before. It was as if I received a severe electroshock... 
                                   it was horribly painful. I could not even cry when I realized what I had done . Since then, 
                                   I decided to do all I can to never make her cry again, but smile forever and paying for all the bad things 
                                   that I have done. Of course, it was a challenge to find my way... but this time I was determine to succeed. 
                                </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Afterwards, I engaged in a deep introspection to define what I liked; and I found out that I liked making 
                            new friends, making people smile and solving their problems by giving them advice. I finally had a passion!
                            To further understand what career I really wanted to follow, I returned to school and successfully completed high school education, 
                            but I never gave up on my favorite sports.</p>

                        <h1>Resume Writer</h1>
                        <p>If you’re good at writing and profiling people, 
                            you could write resumes and CVs for potential employees or students to land them 
                            a chance at whatever they’re applying for. This could fetch you some real cash as people are already 
                            paying to use software to write their resumes.

                                <p> However, during the application period for undergraduate programs, I had a sever injury: 
                                    complete rupture of thigh-knee tendon. I had a surgery. The recovery was really painful, 
                                    but the pain was a mixture of physical and mental stresses. Still on my hospital bed, 
                                    I received a news that my application for the faculty of Political Science and Public Administration 
                                    failed... I was even more depressed; my only chance to succeed vanished... I did not want to live 
                                    anymore.
                                </p>

                                <p>After a week of reflection, I understood that I have only two choice in this life: succeeding or die trying. 
                                    I swore to myself that I will never ever let my passion fade away, no matter what happens. 
                                    From that day, my life changed! I decided to take every challenge, big or small; nourishing my heart with passion
                                     and determination... I made pain and hard times my friends forever.

                                    You can help organizations establish their presence on various social media platforms or you could 
                                    just advertise for organizations on social media. Again you could provide companies with trends 
                                    online to better enhance their product quality or service delivery.

                                <h1>Blogging/Vlogging</h1>
                                <p>Blogging has been around for a while now, so people are already aware of this. 
                                    Vlogging on the hand is quite new, but its all in the same line. 
                                    Blogging deals with getting articles online about something or someone, 
                                    usually a niche you can write so well about, like entertainment, fashion, tech,
                                     etc. Vlogging is also about making videos on subject matters just like the 
                                     above listed. You could just film your travels or even your daily live. 
                                     To make money from this, you would need to pull in some huge traffic to whatever 
                                     platform you are using so you could advertise to people coming on that site 
                                     and earn commissions from these adverts. Usually, most people use YouTube as it 
                                     is easier to monetize your content there.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
                                <p>Creative minds can benefit a lot from this business. 
                                    Once you can put someone’s creative idea or imagination into an artistic piece,
                                     you’re sure to make some real cash here. It could be flyers, banners, posters,
                                     etc, or logos. Just be able to design something catchy and earn on that.
                                </p>
